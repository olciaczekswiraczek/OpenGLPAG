  CMake Deprecation Warning at thirdparty/assimp/CMakeLists.txt:38 (CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED):
    Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
    CMake.
  
    Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
    CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.
  
  
  CMake Warning (dev) at thirdparty/assimp/CMakeLists.txt:39 (PROJECT):
    Policy CMP0048 is not set: project() command manages VERSION variables.
    Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0048" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
    command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
  
    The following variable(s) would be set to empty:
  
      PROJECT_VERSION
      PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR
      PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR
  This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

  CMake Deprecation Warning at thirdparty/assimp/contrib/zlib/CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
    Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
    CMake.
  
    Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
    CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.
  
  
  CMake Deprecation Warning at thirdparty/assimp/contrib/zlib/CMakeLists.txt:8 (cmake_policy):
    The OLD behavior for policy CMP0048 will be removed from a future version
    of CMake.
  
    The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
    policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
    specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
    behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
  
  
  CMake Deprecation Warning at thirdparty/assimp/code/CMakeLists.txt:47 (cmake_minimum_required):
    Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
    CMake.
  
    Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
    CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.
  
  
  CMake Warning (dev) at D:/CMake/share/cmake-3.21/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
    The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (rt) does
    not match the name of the calling package (RT).  This can lead to problems
    in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables (e.g.,
    `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
  Call Stack (most recent call first):
    thirdparty/assimp/cmake-modules/FindRT.cmake:19 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
    thirdparty/assimp/code/CMakeLists.txt:835 (FIND_PACKAGE)
  This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
